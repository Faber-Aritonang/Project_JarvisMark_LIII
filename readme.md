# ⚙️ DODOL — MARK LIII (53)
### The Ultimate Cross-Platform Personal AI Assistant

A real-time voice AI that can hear, see, understand, and control your computer — on any OS. Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. Built on the Gemini Live API for native audio streaming, delivering zero subscriptions and total digital autonomy.

---

## ✨ Overview

**DODOL is the hands-free & scalable release.** Say **"Hey Dodol"** and it wakes; stay quiet and it slips back to sleep on its own — while asleep, your microphone never leaves the machine, so an off-hand *"I'll be right there"* to someone in the room no longer sets it off. Under the hood it now runs on the faster **Gemini 3.1 Flash Live** engine, and the moment you ask for something that takes a beat — analysing a file, searching the web — it answers instantly *("On it — going through that now…")* so you never wonder whether it heard you.

It's also built to grow: every skill — bundled or drop-in — now **describes itself in its own file**, so adding a tool is a one-file operation and the core stays lean.

It's not just an assistant — it's an extension of your digital life.

## 🚀 Capabilities

### Core Features
| Feature | Description |

## 🆕 What's New in Mark LIII

Mark LIII is about making Dodol **hands-free, faster, and easy to extend** — all universal: no hardcoded language, no bundled asset files, works the same on Windows, macOS and Linux.

### 🎙️ Wake Word — "Hey Dodol"
Dodol can now sit quietly until you call it. Turn on **⚙ → WAKE WORD** (a one-click, opt-in download of a tiny local model) and it goes to sleep: the microphone is processed **only on your machine** by a local detector, and nothing is sent to the cloud until it hears **"Hey Dodol."** Once awake it listens normally, then **auto-sleeps after 2 minutes** of silence. You can also **sleep/wake it by clicking** in the settings. Because it's a *local* gate, background chatter — *"I'm coming!"* to someone at home — never wakes it. It costs **zero** when off (the model isn't even loaded), and the detection runs in its own thread, so nothing else in the app slows down.

### ⚡ Instant Acknowledgment
No more silent gaps. When you ask for something that takes a moment — reading an uploaded file, a web/research search, building code — Dodol **immediately** says one short, natural sentence *in your language* (*"Right away — going through that file now."*) and *then* runs the tool. Instant actions (opening an app, volume) stay snappy with no chatter.

### 🚀 Faster Live Engine — Gemini 3.1 Flash Live
The live session moved to **`gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview`**, cutting the time-to-first-word roughly in half while keeping tools, all five voices, transcription, session resumption and sliding-window compression intact.

### 🧩 Self-Describing Skills — a Scalable Core
Every bundled **action** now carries its own `TOOL` declaration in its own file (exactly like a drop-in **plugin's** `PLUGIN` dict), and the core auto-discovers them at launch. `main.py` no longer holds a giant list of tool definitions and dispatch branches — it shrank by hundreds of lines. Adding a new built-in skill, or promoting an `actions/*.py` file into a shareable plugin, is now just… moving a file.

---

## 🔄 The Foundation Update

These core features are the foundation Dodol stands on:

### 🧠 A memory that actually remembers

The store was capped at **2,200 characters — the whole memory, not per entry** — because all of it was pasted into the system prompt on every connect, so growing the memory grew every request. When it filled, the oldest entries were deleted and one line was printed to a console nobody reads.

Storage and prompt budget are now separate problems:

* **Nothing is deleted.** The cap is a runaway guard normal use never approaches.
* **The prompt carries a core, not a dump.** Identity in full, then the most recently updated facts, budgeted.
* **The rest is fetched on demand.** A `recall_memory` tool searches the full store locally — no network, no second model, well under a millisecond.

⚙ → **🧠 MEMORY** shows every stored fact, when it was learned, and a ✕ to forget it. Everything stays in `memory/long_term.json` on your machine.

### ↩️ Undo — it can take back what it did

Dodol moves files, renames them, writes to them and changes your settings. Say **"undo"** — in any language — and it reverses its own last action.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Files** | move · rename · create · copy · write · delete · organize desktop |
| **Settings** | volume · brightness · dark mode |

### ⚠️ A confirmation the model can't forge

Shutdown, restart and WiFi put a banner on the HUD and **return immediately**; the action runs only if you press CONFIRM. Nothing blocks — Dodol keeps talking while the banner is up.

### 🎧 It finally asks which microphone

⚙ → **🎧 AUDIO DEVICES** lets you pick the microphone and the speakers by name. The list is short (deduplicated), and every entry has been measured, not assumed.

### 🔗 It stops forgetting the conversation when the connection drops

The session resumption handle is captured and replayed now. A network blip, or switching your microphone, keeps the conversation intact.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FatihMakes/Mark-LIII.git
cd Mark-LIII
python setup.py        # installs deps for YOUR OS + the browser automation engine
python main.py
```

`setup.py` only ever installs what your operating system needs — the Windows-only libraries are skipped automatically on macOS and Linux (and vice-versa). Prefer to do it by hand? `pip install -r requirements.txt` works too.

> ⚠️ **Installation Note:** If you hit a `ModuleNotFoundError` for an OS-specific package, install it with `pip install <module_name>`. The optional **wake word** engine is *not* installed here — grab it in one click from **⚙ → WAKE WORD** inside the app.

---

## 📋 Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **OS** | Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux |
| **Python** | 3.11 or 3.12 |
| **Microphone** | Required for voice interaction (and for the "Hey Dodol" wake word) |
| **Speakers** | Required for voice replies |
| **API Key** | Free Gemini API key (entered on first launch → `config/api_keys.json`) |
| **Wake word** *(optional)* | One-click download from ⚙ → WAKE WORD (`openwakeword`, a few MB, fully local) |
